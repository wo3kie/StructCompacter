## StructCompacter
StructCompacter reads object (*.o) file in ELF format and using DWARF debug info detects structs and theirs members, calculates padding and tries such shuffle with members to minimalize padding space and save memory.

### Requirements
* pyelftool library (https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pyelftools)
  
  
### How to use is?
>python bin\sc.py priv\library.o
Reading DWARF (may take some time)...
Fixing types...
Finding paddings...
Compacting structs...
... and finally:
Files Mutex.old.64.sc Mutex.new.56.sc created
Done.
  
>vim -d Mutex.old.64.sc Mutex.new.56.sc
